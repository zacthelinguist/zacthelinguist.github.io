<h3>UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA USED TO BE CALLED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS AND I NEVER BOTHERED TO LOOK INTO WHY OR WHEN THIS CHANGED</h3>

<p>i get nervous looking up at the stars</p>
<p>imagine i see some stars start to move</p>
<p>i assume it would be terrifying</p>
<p>i still like looking at the stars, though</p>
<br>
<p>when i was a kid i was afraid of aliens</p>
<p>i'd picture them in my backyard</p>
<p>peeking in through the windows</p>
<p>i believed that if i lay still enough</p>
<p>quiet and calm</p>
<p>then the aliens would be bewildered at my lifelessness and move on</p>
<p>it didn't make sense but that doesn't matter</p>
<p>we have no idea what aliens think or know</p>
<p>maybe it would make sense to them</p>

<br>

<p>i could bore you with other details from my life</p>
<p>about my brother shining a flashlight in our sister's window</p>
<p>about watching the movie signs in a movie theater</p>
<p>about seeing UFOs over washington, d.c.</p>
<p>but that would be boring</p>
<p>and ultimately i'd end with just saying this:</p>
<br>
<p>i don't know if i believe</p>
<p>but it'd be pretty cool if they're here</p>
<p>pretty lucky</p>
<p>if you think about it</p>
<p>discovering extraterrestrial life, you know</p>
<p>just, like</p>
<p>*waves hands*</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>terrestrially</p>

<h3>IT WOULD BE FUNNY IF I ASSERTED SOMETHING SCIENTIFICALLY INACCURATE IN THE TITLE OF ONE OF THESE POEMS
</h3>


<p>		so</p>
<p>		imagine a distant star</p>
<p>		but uh</p>
<p>		let's pretend it's actually a giant gun</p>
<p>		and instead of a bullet</p>
<p>		it shoots a big rock</p>
<p>		i guess it's not a gun</p>
<p>		it's more like a slingshot</p>
<p>		and the rock is the bullet</p>
<p>		what do they call slingshot bullets</p>
<p>		just uh</p>
<p>		let's call it a rock</p>
<p>		so the star gun</p>
<p>		shoots a rock</p>
<p>		but like it shoots a million shots every day</p>
<p>		so now imagine someday one of those bullets hits us</p>
<p>		like it hits the earth</p>
<p>		now imagine the earth is someone's head</p>
<p>		and the star is as far away as another star</p>
<p>		and, like</p>
<p>		think about how hard that would be</p>
<p>		anyway</p>
<p>		there might be some life on one of those bullets</p>
<br>
<p>		it's kinda poetic</p>
<p>		if you think about it

<h3>EUROPAN MERMAID POEM</h3>

<p>everyone's hoping they find microbes</p>	
<p>but i'm a little more optimistic</p>

<h3>WHAT IF THERE'S ONLY ONE LIVING THING LEFT ON EUROPA, LIKE THAT GREENLANDIC SHARK THAT'S SUPER OLD, LIKE WHAT IF IT'S THE LAST LIVING THING ON AN ENTIRE OCEAN PLANET AND IT'S JUST THIS SUPER GNARLY OLD SHARK
</h3>


<p>		i read an article in a magazine last year</p>
<p>		this scientist was trying to study ocean pollution</p>
<p>		she wanted to know if bottom-dwelling fish ate plastic</p>
<p>		like, on accident, like other fish do</p>
<p>		because of all the plastic we put in the ocean</p>
<p>		you know, all the plastic trash</p>
<p>		so she built these special little submarine drone things</p>
<p>		they could go to the bottom of the ocean</p>
<p>		and catch fish with this flimsy plastic net</p>
<p>		this is allegorical</p>
<p>		i think in general humans have good intentions</p>
<p>		or maybe i'm just supposed to say that</p>
<p>		i don't know</p>
<p>		we're always looking for alien life</p>
<p>		we assume finding it will be good for humanity</p>
<p>		the selfless pursuit of truth</p>
<p>		the gleaming sword of progress</p>
<p>		the burnt bridge of the past</p>
<p>		i'm not sure these are real expressions</p>
<p>		but you get what i mean</p>
<p>		you can call anything altruism</p>
<p>		the same way you can call anything anything</p>
<p>		we already invented space trash</p>
<p>		moon trash</p>
<p>		venus trash</p>
<p>		we're good at inventing new kinds of trash</p>
<p>		sorry i was in a bad mood when i wrote this one</p>
<p>		i shouldn't be so negative</p>
<p>		there could be microbes in the geysers on europa</p>
<p>		there could be a fish, even</p>
<p>		that'd be pretty good</p>
<p>		i think people would like that</p>

<h3>ALIENS. ALIENS. ALIENS. ALIENS. ALIENS. OKAY. ALIENS. 
</h3>


<p>we used to believe in monsters</p>
<p>ghosts</p>
<p>spirits</p>
<p>then we empirically destroyed all supernatural beings</p>
<p>bang</p>
<br>
<p>we curated a profoundly extended adolescence within the same generation that we killed magic</p>
<p>it's impressive in its bleak irony</p>
<p>children, naturally bored and, maybe, vaguely hallucinating at all times</p>
<p>thus dully wrought fresh gremlins from the cold iron of scientific inquiry</p>
<br>
<p>small green men in aluminum foil cadillacs</p>
<p>long grey men in phosphorescent tubing</p>
<p>luminous angels, but, like... just some dudes</p>
<br>
<p>i am not embarassed to say i looked for magic in the sky</p>
<p>doodled my wizards wrapped in jumpsuits and lightbulbs</p>
<p>runted my capacity for belief within a post-consumer goods hellscape</p>
<p>but i am a little sad that i had to

<h3>THE MODERN MIRACLE OF NOTHING EVER SEEMING MIRACULOUS ANYMORE. THE INFINITE FUTURE OF A SPECIES EVOLVED TO ONLY EVER EXPERIENCE THE FINITE. I WANT TO DESIRE SOMETHING IN A WAY I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE
</h3>


<p>it seemed like they were always finding water on mars</p>
<p>when i was a kid</p>
<p>there was always some new probe </p>
<p>or robot </p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>finding water under a rock </p>
<p>or like... in a rock, maybe</p>
<p>i don't know</p>
<br>
<p>it was exciting at first but then seemed funny</p>
<p>i just checked and they're still finding water on mars</p>
<p>or evidence of water on mars</p>
<p>people still seem excited about it</p>
<p>and it still seems funny to me</p>
<br>
<p>eventually, maybe</p>
<p>it will seem like they are always finding life on some planet</p>
<p>maybe there will always be some new probe</p>
<p>or robot</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>finding life under a rock</p>
<p>or like... in a rock, maybe</p>
<p>i don't know</p>
<br>
<p>that'd be good</p>
<p>i think we can all agree that'd be exciting</p>
<p>at least for a while

<h3>OLD BONE
</h3>


<p>	what if they found an old bone in space</p>
<p>	just the one weird bone</p>
<br>
<p>	pretty spooky</p>
<p>	whose bone could it be</p>
<p>	etc.</p>
<br>
<p>	are you scared yet

<h3>I FEEL LIKE I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT THINGS ABOUT THE EARTH THAT I COULD NEVER ACCEPT ABOUT MYSELF
</h3>


<p>there could be life on an asteroid</p>
<p>i never knew much about asteroids</p>
<p>so that felt unlikely, to me</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>like</p>
<br>
<p>i recently learned that the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was so big (like a dinosaur, you could say)</p>
<p>and so destructive</p>
<p>and so grotesquely violent</p>
<p>and so much like a ceaseless, apocalyptic helldeath</p>
<p>that it basically, like, ripped the earth apart</p>
<p>and some chunks of the earth went into space</p>
<br>
<p>and those chunks are asteroids now</p>
<p>and they could have life on them (earth life)</p>
<p>and they could come back</p>
<p>with a vengeance</p>
<p>jurrasic park 5: the vengence of the ceaseless, apocalyptic helldeath

<h3>WE ARE THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS THAT SOMEONE 352 MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY FEELS DUBIOUS ABOUT... TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, BEING AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL IS A RECIPRICAL RELATIONSHIP... THERE IS NO THEM WITHOUT US... DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT... THIS FEELS PROFOUND IN A STUPID AND EMBARASSING WAY... BUT ALL GREAT ART MUST STRIVE TO BE PROFOUND, STUPID, AND EMBARASSING... DO YOU AGREE? WILL YOU TELL OTHER PEOPLE?

<p>	they found a new exoplanet</p>
<p>	i mean they're always finding a new exoplanet</p>
<p>	but like</p>
<p>	i mean</p>
<p>	this one seems good</p>
<p>	the guy said there might be life on it</p>
<br>
<p>	like</p>
<p>	intelligent life maybe</p>
<p>	like there might be people on the exoplanet</p>
<p>	basically</p>
<p>	which is cool</p>
<br>
<p>	hey</p>
<br>
<p>	hey do you think they're cool</p>
<p>	do you think they feel love</p>
<br>
<p>	do you think they have dogs
