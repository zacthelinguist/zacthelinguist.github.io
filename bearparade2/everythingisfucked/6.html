        <h2>everything is totally fucked 2</h2>

<p>
To celebrate that everything was totally fucked, I grew out my hair. I cut it off. I grew it out. I cut it off. It kept growing. I kept cutting. It kept growing. A guy I knew in high school ran his car off the road and it burst into flames; he crawled out while on fire and he died in the grass between the tree and the road. I don't know where any of my hair went when I cut it off. Itâ€™s all gone now, probably in a landfill.
