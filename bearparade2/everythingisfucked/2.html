I'm trying to convert a file from one file format to another file format. I'm not sure how to do it. I try renaming the file manually but the program that needs the file to be in this new format doesn't recognize it as a valid file of that format. I am looking this up online. I use the search engine that everyone uses. Some of the links are advertisements for software that can convert files and costs $59.95. Some of the links are for blogs designed to sell copies of self-help ebooks. Some of the links are content aggregators that include links to the advertisements for software that can convert files and costs $59.95 and blogs designed to sell copies of self-help ebooks. I keep thinking "converting files" over and over again while scrolling and clicking on links. I click the little X's in various advertisements and pop-ups about cookies and pop-ups about installing applications and pop-ups about getting updates and pop-ups about signing up for newsletters and pop-ups about subscribing to online machine learning classes. I think, "converting files." I spend seven hours scrolling and clicking and thinking "converting files." A man walks up to my desk and asks if I'm busy. I'm sweating and I'm very thirsty. I clear my throat and tell him I'm busy. I point at my computer screen without looking at him. I don't recognize his voice. My eyes are kind of unfocused. I think, "converting files." I click on a link and it prompts me to upload my file. The man asks me what I'm doing. I click the file upload button while thinking "converting files." The file browser opens up and I navigate to the file. The man walks closer. I'm still pointing at the screen. I think "converting files" while selecting the file. I click the wrong file. I can't see that well. My eyes hurt. The man is closer. I'm sweating. I'm thinking "converting files." My finger is touching the screen. The man is next to me. I think, "converting files." I click on a button that says, "select". The man is sweating. The man is whispering something. I think, "converting files." My finger is bent from the force of pressing on the screen. I click "convert file." The blood is draining from my finger. I think, "converting files." The man whispers, "converting files." I look at my finger. It looks like a sixth finger, like my hand has six fingers, or like my hand has a penis, and, for a second, I think, "penis fingers." The website says, "converting file(s)."
