I'm sitting in the passenger seat of Darien's shitty 2003 Aztek. I'm holding the pizzas we have to deliver. Darien asks if I like metal and I don't say anything because I don't like metal but Darien is training me on delivering pizzas and I don't want him to dislike me. Darien puts on some metal and drinks two tiny bottles of Hot Damn. The pizzas are warm in my lap. I think about my penis being warmed by the pizzas while Darien puts the car into reverse. He peels out over the gravel behind the pizza place, arcing us backwards while staring straight through the windshield. He puts the car into drive and looks at the pizzas in my lap for two or three seconds. I look at him looking at the pizzas. He puts the car into drive and drives us through the alley and hits one of the metal trash cans. I hear him talking to himself as if he's talking to someone else. I think about a Zachary German story I read the night before. In the story, a character named Zachary German spends four hours alone in a café drinking coffee and looking at social media on his phone. He slips on some ice on his way to the car afterwards and lands on his ass. He thinks, "Bitch, I'll fucking kill you." He drives home while listening to a local radio station. He goes into his apartment and sees his wife and child playing with a wooden train. He looks at the train and thinks, "Bitch, I'll fucking kill you." Zachary German and his wife and child each eat a banana and some plain yogurt at the dining room table. He tells his wife that he wrote four thousand words at the café but would probably cut a good portion of it later. He throws the banana peels and leftover yogurt away and looks at the banana peels and yogurt in the trash can and thinks, "Bitch, I'll fucking kill you." They leave the apartment and drive to a music class for toddlers. In the music class for toddlers, Zachary German dances enthusiastically as part of a large circle of parents also dancing enthusiastically. He looks at himself dancing in the mirror and thinks, "Bitch, I'll fucking kill you." During the part of the music class for toddlers where all the toddlers get to play with tambourines, he sits on a chair and feels a strong desire to smoke a cigarette or drink a large cup of coffee or walk through a thunderstorm while crying uncontrollably and thinks, "Bitch, I'll fucking kill you.". During the part of the music class for toddlers where they all dance in a line and loop around and hold their hands up together to form a tunnel for the rest of the loop of people to walk under, he holds his toddler at the edge of the human tunnel and thinks, "Bitch, I'll fucking kill you." During the part of the music class for toddlers where everyone lies down in the dark and sings quietly, he looks at his wife's body and imagines himself making love to her and thinks, "Bitch, I'll fucking kill you.". Later that night, in bed, after making love to his wife, Zachary German thinks about having sex with a pizza. I stop thinking about the story because that's where the story ends. Darien's still mumbling to himself. I feel like I might get decapitated by a semi-truck tire rupturing on the highway. Darien narrows his eyes and points through the windshield like he's trying to start shit with someone. Darien says, "Hey man, you're eating a <i>dick</i> pizza, man."
