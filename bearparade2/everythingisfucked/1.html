Barack Obama put a bag of red lentils and a chopped onion and a bay leaf into the crockpot and turned it on low for six to eight hours. He turned off the crockpot and took out the bay leaf and ate the lentils while watching the public access channel. He called his girlfriend long distance but she didn't answer. He washed the crockpot and bowl and spoon and lay on his mattress. He smoked a cigarette and thought about being a famous author. He thought about being president. He thought about moving to Montana and opening an organic food cooperative; he imagined himself shooting a rifle in a big empty field at a cardboard cutout, smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. He stood up and looked through his dresser for clothes he didn't need any more and put them in a bag by the front door of his apartment. He sat at his typewriter and wrote a story:<i> I will rip out your teeth! I will rip out my teeth! I will shuffle our teeth together like cards! Like a deck of playing cards! The shuffling will make a special sound! That sound will be the sound of my love for you! We're going to the beach! I will throw you into the surf! I will fish you out with a fishing pole! You will flap your arms like fins! Above the water! I will reel you in! I will put you into a bucket of water! You will bleed in the water and you will die in the bucket! I will take you home and put you to bed! And we will do it again the next day! I will break into your dad's house! I will pretend to be your mom! Your dad will kiss me on the lips! I will kiss him back! I will cook him dinner! He will grout the tile in the upstairs bathroom! I will call you on the phone! I will tell you I love you! And I will eat cookies in bed! And I will watch cable television with your dad! And I will go to sleep without brushing my teeth! And your dad will try to kiss me again! And I won't kiss him back! And your dad will get the hint! And your dad will roll over and face the wall! And I will roll over and face the other wall! And I won't have sex with your dad! And I will leave in the middle of the night! You will give me all of your laundry! And I won't do your laundry! I'll just leave it at the laundromat! I'll disappear! You'll never hear from me again! I'll be gone! You will have to get your laundry on your own! Years will go by! You will try to look me up in the phone book! But eventually you'll move on! You'll fall in love with someone else! That person will do your laundry! That person won't disappear! That person won't break into your dad's house! That person won't fish you out of the ocean! That person won't rip out your teeth! You'll be so happy! For years! And when you die, you won't remember me!</i> He looked at the story and corrected typos with a fine-tipped blue pen while smoking a cigarette. He tried calling his girlfriend again. He sat at his desk ¬¬and thought about his father's death, about what it'd feel like to die in a car crash, about how he'd probably die before anything good could ever happen again. He turned off the desk lamp and lay in bed. He thought about what he could do to improve the story he was working on. He masturbated to a memory of his fifth-grade math teacher and when he finished, he realized he couldn't remember her name.
