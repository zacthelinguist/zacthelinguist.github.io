<p>
To celebrate that everything was totally fucked, I blew some bubbles. The wind carried them off. They went over the ocean. A whale breached the water. A bubble popped in its eye. The soap cleaned all the salt and scum off its eye. The whale saw the unending horizon of the ocean, the endless expanse of flat water and empty sky in all directions. The whale reentered the water. The whale blinked. The whale thought about the endlessness. The whale thought about swimming, breaching, diving, eating, shitting, holding its breath, straining to breach the water to breath, blowing water out of its blowhole, breathing in air, entering the water, moving and straining and trying to survive for years and years and years. The whale thought about the ocean, how it never ends, how it continues on in every direction and somehow loops back onto itself. The whale thought about how long life is, about its daily struggle with death, about the pain of every moment which will accrete into the thing that ultimately kills it, how it will someday be unable to breach the surface of the water and breath, and then will die in a protracted agony. The whale ate a moderate amount of plankton and felt tired. The whale breached and looked at the endless expanse of flat water and empty sky in all directions again. the whale felt its vision grow blurry again from the salt and dirt and fish shit and scum that floats on the top of the water. I saw a nature documentary once about how large whale penises are â€“ most are larger than I am, sometimes up to ten feet long. I blew some more bubbles. The wind carried them off. I felt, briefly and indignantly, that I was actually somehow larger than a whale penis.
