<p>
I spilled all the yogurt on the floor. I'm putting yogurt back into the container. Into the tub thing. It's a big tub. It's a lot of yogurt. Two spoons to be quicker. Not actually that quick. Trying one spoon plus a hand to, like, wall the yogurt in. Biiig scoops. Typed three i's on accident but it seems good, like a branding thing. Biiiiig scoops. Ok, the spoon still sucks. Just my hands, just using my hands. Fuck it. Yogurt everywhere, no time. They're just hands. Yogurt isn't bad for your hands. It's probably good for your hands. And the yogurt is more important. It's like thirty dollars' worth of yogurt, that thin whole milk yogurt. If this were Greek yogurt it'd be easy. Greek yogurt's thick as shit. You could just pick it up like a baseball. But this is the runny yogurt. It just keeps spreading out. It's lumpy but not that lumpy. I always wonder about the lumps. Should yogurt be lumpy? It's probably fine. Goddamn it all. Not gonna lick my fingers. Not yet. This is probably ruining all the yogurt. But I gotta try. I have to try and save the yogurt. You can't eat that $30 back. If you can save $20, that's good. $10 is worth it. Even saving $2.50 worth of this yogurt is worth it. Scoop, slop, scoop, slop. Make it a Viking song. Heave, ho, motherfucker. Yogurt up, yogurt down. This doesn't look right. Lots of spots and specks. Off-white yogurt. Probably no good. I can't remember last time I washed my hands. Living alone means I don't have anyone to give a yeast infection to. That used to be my problem in high school – I gave Lena yeast infections like every two weeks because I never washed my hands. She used yogurt to fix them, somehow. What the fuck was that. Yogurt fixing yeast infections. Yogurt as pussy medicine. $30 dollars' worth. I started washing my hands so I could finger her more. Then we broke up and I stopped. I never did get back into the habit. It saves money. Saves on soap. Live frugally. Less is more. Save the whales. Save the yogurt. Heave, ho, heave, ho. This isn't that much yogurt. I should give up. No, it's a lot. It's worth it. But I gotta take a break. It's not spreading out as much anymore. It's stabilized. I can stop for a second. I'm sweating. It's so hot. Not used to hunching over like this. Feeling kinda dizzy. Stood up too fast. Need to eat more yogurt. Maybe I'm low in iron. I'm breathing. I should wash my hands. I should go to the doctor. Push-ups, dead lifts. That's how it goes. Bigger, better, faster, stronger. Small steps. Eat yogurt, that was a step. Gut bacteria, protein, healthy fats. And it's cheap. $30 goes a long way. It felt like a good start. Gotta look out for myself. I'm all on my own. If I don't scoop it all up, what else am I going to do? I'm not going to, like, hose off the floor. I don't own any hoses. I don't own any mops. I have to do this no matter what. So I might as well do it now. I have yogurt on my hands already. God, there's yogurt everywhere. And there's sweat everywhere. Can't scratch my balls. Don't do it. More steps: buy more underwear, then wear the underwear. Gotta get a list together. Lena had lots of lists. My hands are sweaty. Jesus. Ok. Salty yogurt is a thing. It's ok.  It's a European thing. I should google it to be sure. Put it on the list. The yogurt in the tub looks kind of… bad. It looks sandy. There's sand on the floor. Dunno why. But I've never cleaned my floor. I don't own any brooms. I don't own many… anythings… or something. I should buy a broom. Here's the list: $30 yogurt. $30 soap. $30 underwear. $30 broom. Use the fuck out of it all. Biiiig sweeps, baby, biiig sweeps, girl. I could pitch a jingle. Piiitch a jiiingle. Ok. Hooo-boy. I can do this. Think about the future. Think about tomorrow. Think about eating yogurt and living a good life. Scoop, slop, scoop, slop. Feels like a metaphor. I should call Lena. No, she's dead. Ok. I think I saved, like, $15 worth of yogurt. That's pretty good.
