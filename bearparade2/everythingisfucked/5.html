        <h2>everything is totally fucked 1</h2>

<p>
To celebrate that everything was totally fucked, we burned down many things. We burned down the house. We burned down the neighborâ€™s house. We burned down the church. We burned down the other church (cathartic). We burned down the mosque. We burned down the diner. We burned down the tire place (smelled bad). We burned down the library. We burned down the athletic center. We burned down the public pool (difficult). We burned down the vacant lot. We burned down the woods. We burned down the elementary school. We burned down the grocery store. We burned down the Burger King (mistake). We burned down the nature preserve. We burned down the high school. We burned down the pier. We burned down the middle school. We burned down the candy store. We burned down the hardware store. We burned down the Italian restaurant (smelled good). We burned down the cabinet store. We burned down the other cabinet store. We burned down the other other cabinet store (over on route 42). We burned down the fourth and final cabinet store (success).
