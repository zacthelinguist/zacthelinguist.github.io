Girl scouts sell their cookies at the train station. Every day they yell to the people boarding and exiting the trains that they are selling cookies and that you can use a credit card to buy the cookies. Some of the girl scouts accosted a woman who was trying to ignore them. They surrounded her and brandished the boxes of cookies at her and told her that she should buy cookies. She told the girl scouts to fuck off and tried to push her way through them, but she had a hard time because she was, at the same time, trying to not touch them. The girl scouts followed her through the turnstile in a compact line so that the turnstile buzzed loudly to indicate that someone as attempting to access the train area without paying. The woman stood by the edge of the tracks while the girl scouts yelled at her and called her a fucking bitch and told her to buy cookies. When the train was coming, one of the girl scouts pushed her onto the tracks. All the girl scouts waited for the girl scout who pushed the woman to say a badass line like in a movie or something but she couldn’t think of anything cool to say on the spot and looked visibly frustrated and embarrassed, and then the train conductor stopped the train early so he wouldn’t run over the woman. Then the woman climbed out from the train track area and pointed at the girl scout who pushed her and said told her to go fuck herself. The girl scout’s mom swiped her card to access the platform and ran up with a box of cookies and told her to have a free box and that she was sorry. The woman took the box of cookies and boarded the train and went to work. The woman ate all the cookies in one sitting. The woman is me. I am the woman. They were thin mints.
