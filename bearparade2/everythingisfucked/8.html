A mouse climbed onto the top of a man’s head. The mouse pulled the man’s hair and controlled him like a puppet. The mouse made the man apply for a good job. The mouse made the man work 9-6 every weekday for ten years. The mouse made the man start a Roth IRA and invest in his 401k. The mouse made the man buy ingredients in bulk and cook food. The mouse made the man go to an open house in a neighborhood with low property values but a burgeoning commercial area and convenient access to the highway. The mouse made the man put in an offer on the house. The mouse made the man invest in solar panels and good windows. The mouse made the man replace the lawn with regionally appropriate and biodiverse flora. The mouse made the man work out every day. The mouse made the man call is parents twice a week. The mouse made the man go on dates. The mouse made the man marry a wonderful person. The mouse made the man have children. The mouse made the man take his family camping. The mouse made the man take up stamp collecting. The mouse made the man invest in the stock market. The mouse made the man encourage his children to pursue their dreams. The mouse made the man set up a good life insurance plan. The mouse made the man transition into consulting work to spend more time with his family. The mouse made the man take classes at the adult learning annex. The mouse made the man retire early and travel with his wife after the kids graduated college. The mouse made the man look up at the stars at night. The mouse made the man spend time in nature. The mouse made the man kiss his wife every night before bed. The mouse made the man tell her that he loved her. The mouse made the man close his eyes and go to sleep.
