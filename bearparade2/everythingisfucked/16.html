        <h2>accomodation</h2>

<p>
She waits outside the bathroom door. She has to piss. She always has to piss. She's always holding in her piss, feeling shitty, feeling full of piss, and always waiting. Waiting to get somewhere, to get home, to feed the kids, to park the car, to sort the mail. And they have just the one bathroom. She's waiting. She hates it. She hates the wait. She hates the wait for him to stop shitting. Her husband, shitting. Her, waiting. Him, using the bathroom to shit. Her, waiting outside the bathroom to piss. The discrepancy bothers her. She has to hold just a little bit of piss and wait, wait, wait for him to shit. She wishes she could get in first, but he's always beating her there. It's always a race and he's always winning and he doesn't even know it. She stands, she paces, holding in her piss. She wats every day. She waits for him to shit so that she can piss. And she's tired of it. She hates it. She wonders how he could possibly shit so much, or so long. She imagines a slow, slow shit, just barely forthcoming from her husband's ass. It disgusts her, the slow shitting. She shits quick, always quick. She hides her shit the same way she hides herself. She read that, once, in Granta. She doesn't know who wrote it, but it spoke to her. She hides her shit the same way she hides herself. It stayed with her because it's so true: she shits in secret; she shits without anyone knowing it. She feels ashamed, always ashamed by her shit, which means she's ashamed by herself, is the idea. It feels right, poignant. She marvels at how shitting can be shameful for her and not for him, but there's nothing to marvel at, it's obvious, it's stupid. She hates it. She hates all of it, but the dichotomy, specifically. She hates shitting so secretly while her husband shits so publicly, so...  prolifically. Her, shitting shamefully. Him, shitting proudly. Her, shitting in the dark corners of everyone's life. Him, shitting in the open, freely. Her, holding her piss and pacing. Him, letting loose his shit and relaxing. She waits, cramped, sweaty. She holds her piss. She waits, pacing, suffering, wincing. He shits, he shits, he shits, and she waits, patiently, always patiently, always patient, calm, sweet, deferent, accommodating. She suffers through holding her piss to accommodate his shitting. She suffers through holding her piss to accommodate his humanity. He's human and he shits. She doesn't shit, so she lets the question run its course. She asks the question, and the answer is there, and it hurts. It hurts, and she doesn't want to hurt anymore. She breaths in. She breaths out. She squares her shoulders. She sets her jaw. She opens the door. She looks at her husband, squatting over the toilet. She sees him looking terrified, exposed, pathetic, small. His bare ass in profile. His mouth in a half-grimace. His shoulders stooped, hunched up. His arm, outstretched. His hand, wrapped in toilet paper, his shit propped inexplicably on the wad in his open palm.
