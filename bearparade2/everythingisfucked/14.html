        <h2>leap of faith</h2>

<p>
There was a really bad month where every night Billy stayed up late after his wife went to bed. He would listen to podcasts and play a skateboarding video game. He had vague memories of how it all worked from when he played it as a kid, all the best combos, unlocking all the secret areas, and getting high scores. He'd spend two to five hours doing kickflips and darkslides in places he'd never been to, like Tokyo or California, while listening to men from New Zealand talk about movies he'd never seen.</p><p>
One of these nights he paused the game and stared at the tv screen because everything felt extra bad and different. When he was in eighth grade he went to a church camp. At the end, the youth pastors sat him in a room and asked if he believed in Jesus. He panicked, feeling overwhelmed by what was happening, and he saw their heads grow grotesquely huge, as if he was seeing, for the first time, what the world around him truly looked like without the leveling filter of experience and expectation. He was thirsty, hot, sweaty, cold, and his eyesight went grey and swirly. The youth pastors were flopping balloons, or horrible oil paintings of flopping balloons. He stammered through a non-answer about Jesus so he could leave, to be free of what was happening. He felt that way again, staring at the tv screen. He felt fully detached from himself. He thought, Whoever this person is, he is doing a bad job, he shouldn't be playing this videogame, he shouldn't be ignoring his obligations, he shouldn't be doing what he's doing at all, but he's still doing it even though he should stop.</p><p>
He often used a cell phone application called Twitter to view and recommend to others a diverse array of ironic, cynical, sarcastically violent, earnestly violent, and/or politically extreme media that leveraged characters and stylistic themes/imagery from Japanese animation, low-resolution still shots and promotional material from outdated computer games, and assorted icono-graphy, turns of phrase, and/or images appropriated from disparate internet communities of which he was not a member. But he also used the cell phone application to communicate his earnest thoughts and feelings so that people on the internet could console him in his depression or talk him down during bad episodes of anxiety.</p><p>
He tweeted about how he felt this strange detachment and someone sent him a Twitter direct message saying that he was probably having a dissociative episode and that even though it happens to people sometimes, he shouldn't tweet about it, because of how employers and family and whoever else can see his tweets and might do something that would make his life worse, like send him to a psychiatric hospital or prevent him from getting a different job. He thanked the person over Twitter direct message, deleted the tweet, and read most of the "Dissociative disorder" article on Wikipedia.</p><p>
He unpaused the skateboarding video game. He disassociated some more. He had a hard time playing the game but liked having a word for what was happening. He paused the skateboarding video game. He looked at Twitter. He saw a brand entity icon account post a joke about video games. Billy replied to the brand entity icon account's post with a death threat. The brand entity icon account was verified on Twitter. Billy looked up how to be verified on Twitter. The Twitter verification process required a photo identification and filling out bureaucratic-seeming forms; it didn't seem to make any sense for a brand to be verified on Twitter.</p><p>
Billy deleted his death threat and then tweeted at the brand entity icon account to ask if it had photo identification. The brand entity icon account quote-tweeted Billy's tweet alongside a picture of a man being stabbed in the neck. The picture seemed real and was exceptionally graphic. There was blood and the beginnings of a gaping wound. The brand entity icon account called Billy a dumb piece of shit in the quote tweet. Billy faved the threatening and violent tweet out of a vague hope that it would diffuse things. He unpaused the skateboarding video game and worriedly played game for fifteen minutes. </p><p>
He paused the game and checked Twitter and saw that the brand entity icon's quote-tweet had been deleted. He saw that the brand entity icon account tweeted an apology about being hacked. The apology got several thousand faves from people who follow the brand entity icon account. Billy received a direct message from the brand entity icon account. The brand entity icon account's direct message called him a little bitch. The brand entity icon account sent another direct message calling him a fucking narc. The brand entity icon account sent another direct message with a picture of the man being stabbed in the neck. It looked like the same man from the first photo being stabbed for a second time. Billy saw both neck wounds full of shiny blood. He saw that the brand entity icon account was typing another direct message. </p><p>
He closed the Twitter application and looked at the tv screen. He closed the Twitter application and put down his phone. He picked up his phone. He opened the Twitter application. He saw that the brand entity icon account sent another direct message. He looked at the message preview and thought, This seems really bad, and laughed uncomfortably, waking his wife.
