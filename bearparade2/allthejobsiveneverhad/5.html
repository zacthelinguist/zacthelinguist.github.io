    <h1>DREAM JOB<br>&nbsp;
</h1>



<div style="padding:20px;height:200px;">

<p>
Let me level with you. Be honest. I don't like working. I don't like people. I don't like being alive. But being loved makes me feel good. If someone were to love me, I think, I would make a good employee. So my dream job is to be loved. If I had a wish, it would be for some doctor or lawyer lady to fall desperately in love with me. She would give me an allowance and let me make art all day. She would kiss me on the forehead and look at my art and say "Wow! That's really special. You're really special. I love you." And that's it. That's my dream job. To be loved and left to create art. I know that sounds spoiled. Impossible. It's just a fantasy. I will probably end up working at a gas station instead.
