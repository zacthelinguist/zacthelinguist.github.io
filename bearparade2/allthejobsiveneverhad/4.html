    <h1>FREELANCE SUICIDE NOTE WRITER
</h1>



<div style="padding:20px;height:200px;">
<br>
<p>
Like a resume writer but cooler. I have written SO MANY suicide notes. I'm basically an expert on suicide notes. I wrote my first suicide note at 16 and I laminated it and wrote an essay to every person I loved and placed the note in a 3-ring binder. My plan was to go stay the night at my friend's house and overdose on the pills in his cabinet (his parents were doctors). But we played video games and got high and I fell asleep so I forgot to kill myself. I wrote my second suicide note at 17. And then 18. And then 19. And then 20. And for three years I did not write a single suicide note. But I just did. I just wrote a suicide note after applying to some jobs, which seems silly. I am 24. The suicide note was so good, though, that I thought: <i>Hey! Maybe this is it. Maybe this is my calling.</i> So if you hire me as a freelance suicide note writer, I think I will do very good at it. And maybe I won't feel like writing my own anymore. Plus, I like helping people! :D
